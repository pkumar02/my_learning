    "* Machine learning is a field of study that focuses on computer systems that can learn from data.That is, these systems, often called ``models``,can learn to perform a specific task by analyzing lots of examples for a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the model learns to perform this task from data,it's good to note that the amount and quality of data available for building the model are important factors in how well the model learns from the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Machine Learning models can learn from data,they can be ``used to discover hidden patterns and trends in the data`` as well.These trends and patterns lead to valuable insights into the data, thus the use of Machine Learning allows for data driven functions to be made for a particular problem.\n",
    "So to summarize,\n",
    ">The field of Machine Learning focuses on the study and construction of computer systems that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques are used to build models to discover hidden patterns and trends in the data, allowing for data driven decisions to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of other terms we hear in conversations about Machine Learning. The term ```data mining``` became popular around the time that the use of databases became commonplace. So data mining was used to refer to activities related to finding patterns in databases and data warehouses. There are some practical data management aspects to data mining related to accessing data from databases, but the process of finding patterns in data is similar to Machine Learning and often uses similar algorithms and techniques.\n",
    "```Predictive analytics``` is another term, and it refers to analyzing data in order to predict future outcomes. This term is usually used in the business context to describe activities such as sales forecasting or predicting the purchase of behavior of a customer. But again, the techniques used to make these predictions are the same techniques for Machine Learning. \n",
    "As we have discussed before, ```data science``` is a new term that's used to describe the process of processing and analyzing data to extract meaning. And again, Machine Learning techniques can also be used here. Because the term data science became popular at the same time that big data began appearing, data science usually refers to extracting meaning from big data."

A pair $(x^{(i)} , y^{(i)} )$ is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples $(x^{(i)},y^{(i)});i=1,...,m $-is called a training set.

    "Our objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case, the value of $J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$ will be 0. The following example shows the ideal situation where we have a cost function of 0.\n",

For example, the three green points found on the green line above have the same value for $J(\\theta_0,\\theta_1)$ and as a result, they are found along the same line. The circled x displays the value of the cost function for the graph on the left when $\\theta_0 = 800$ and $\\theta_1= -0.15$. Taking another $h(x)$ and plotting its contour plot, one gets the following graphs:\n",

    "### Gradient Descent\n",

    "We put $\\theta_0$ on the x axis and $\\theta_1$ on the y axis, with the cost function on the vertical z axis. The points on our graph will be the result of the cost function using our hypothesis with those specific theta parameters. The graph below depicts such a setup.\n",

    "\n",
    "The way we do this is by taking the derivative (the tangential line to a function) of our cost function. The slope of the tangent is the derivative at that point and it will give us a direction to move towards. We make steps down the cost function in the direction with the steepest descent. The size of each step is determined by the parameter $\\alpha$, which is called the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the distance between each 'star' in the graph above represents a step determined by our parameter α. A smaller α would result in a smaller step and a larger α results in a larger step. The direction in which the step is taken is determined by the partial derivative of $J(\\theta_0,\\theta_1)$. Depending on where one starts on the graph, one could end up at different points. The image above shows us two different starting points that end up in two different places.\n",

Note that, while gradient descent can be susceptible to local minima in general, the optimization problem we have posed here for linear regression has only one global, and no other local, optima; thus gradient descent always converges (assuming the learning rate α is not too large) to the global minimum. Indeed, J is a convex quadratic function. Here is an example of gradient descent as it is run to minimize a quadratic function.\n",
