    "## Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because $\\theta$ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{−}1 \\leq x_{(i)} \\leq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{−}0.5 \\leq x_{(i)} \\leq 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two techniques to help with this are **feature scaling** and **mean normalization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Feature scaling` involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. \n",
    "`Mean normalization` involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dfrac{x_i - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu_i$ is the average of all the values for feature (i) and ${\\sigma_i}$ is the range of values (max - min), or ${\\sigma_i}$ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that dividing by the range, or dividing by the standard deviation, give different results. The quizzes in this course use range - the programming exercises use standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $x_i$ represents housing prices with a range of 100 to 2000 and a mean value of 1000, then, $\\dfrac{price-1000}{1900}$"

    "We can **combine** multiple features into one. For example, we can combine $x_1$ and $x_2$ into a new feature $x_3$ by taking $x_1 \\cdot x_2$.\n",
    "### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis function need not be linear (a straight line) if that does not fit the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can **change the behavior or curve** of our hypothesis function by making it a quadratic, cubic or square root function (or any other form).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our hypothesis function is $h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1$ then we can create additional features based on $x_1$, to get the quadratic function $h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^2$ or the cubic function $h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^2 + \\theta_3 x_1^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cubic version, we have created new features $x_2$ and $x_3$ where $x_2 = x_1^2$ and $x_3 = x_1^3$.\n",

    "​\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to keep in mind is, if you choose your features this way then feature scaling becomes very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "eg. if $x_1$ has range 1 - 1000 then range of $x_1^2$ becomes 1 - 1000000 and that of $x_1^3$ becomes 1 - 1000000000"

    "\n",
    "Gradient descent gives one way of minimizing J. Let’s discuss a second way of doing so, this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. In the \"Normal Equation\" method, we will minimize J by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the $θ_j$ ’s, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find the optimum theta without iteration. The normal equation formula is given below:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Normal Equation Noninvertibility\n",
    "\n",
