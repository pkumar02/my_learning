Hence, if most of our misclassified emails are those which try to steal passwords, then we could find some features that are particular to those emails and add them to our model.

For example if we use stemming, which is the process of treating the same word with different forms (fail/failing/failed) as one word (fail), and get a 3% error rate instead of 5%, then we should definitely add it to our model. However, if we try to distinguish between upper case and lower case letters and end up getting a 3.2% error rate instead of 3%, then we should avoid using this new feature. Hence, we should try new things, get a numerical value for our error rate, and based on our result decide whether we want to keep the new feature or not."

    "For this we can use **Precision/Recall**.\n",
    "Predicted: 1, Actual: 1 --- True positive\n",
    "Predicted: 0, Actual: 0 --- True negative\n",
    "Predicted: 0, Actual, 1 --- False negative\n",

    "* **Note 1**: if an algorithm predicts only negatives like it does in one of exercises, the precision is not defined, it is impossible to divide by 0. `F1 score` will not be defined too.\n",
    "* **Note 2**: a manual calculation of precision and other functions is a error prone process. it is very easy though to create an Excel file for this. Put into it a table 2*2 for all necessary input values, label them like \"TruePositives\", \"FalsePositives\", and on other cells of Excel add formulas like =SUM(TruePositive,FalsePositive, TrueNegative, FalseNegative), label this one AllExamples.

So it's the threshold that says, do we need to be at least 70% confident or 90% confident, or whatever before we predict y=1. And by varying the threshold, we can control a trade off between precision and recall. We also talked about the F Score, which takes precision and recall, and again, gives you a single real number evaluation metric. And of course, if your goal is to automatically set that threshold to decide what's really y=1 and y=0, one pretty reasonable way to do that would also be to try a range of different values of thresholds. So you try a range of values of thresholds and evaluate these different thresholds on, say, your cross-validation set and then to pick whatever value of threshold gives you the highest F Score on your cross validation. And that be a pretty reasonable way to automatically choose the threshold for your classifier as well. "
