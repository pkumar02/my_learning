    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "Recommendation is currently a very popular application of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we are trying to recommend movies to customers. We can use the following definitions\n",
    "$\\qquad n_u$ = number of users\n",
    "$\\qquad n_m$ = number of movies\n",
    "$\\qquad r(i,j) = 1$ if user $j$\t has rated movie $j$\n",
    "$\\qquad y(i,j)$ = rating given by user $j$ to movie $j$ (defined only if $r(i,j) = 1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Based Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can introduce two features,$x_1$ and $x_2$ which represents how much romance or how much action a movie\n",
    "may have (on a scale of 0 âˆ’ 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is that we could do linear regression for every single user. For each user $j$, learn a parameter $\\theta^{(j)} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Predict user  $j$ as rating movie $i$ with $\\big(\\theta ^{(j)}\\big)^{T}x^{(i)}$ stars.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\qquad m^{(j)}$ = number of movies rated by user \t\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn $\\theta^{(j)}$, we do the following\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ min_{\\displaystyle \\theta^{(j)}} = \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}  \\sum_{i:r(i,j)=1} ((\\theta^{(j)})^T(x^{(i)})-y^{(i,j)})^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^n (\\theta_k^{(j)})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our familiar linear regression. The base of the first summation is choosing all $i$ such that $r(i,j) = 1$.\n",

    "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "It can be very difficult to find features such as \"amount of romance\" or \"amount of action\" in a movie. To figure this out, we can use *feature finders*.\n",

    "ensures that the algorithm learns features $x^{(1)},\\dots, x^{ \\displaystyle(n_m)}$ that are different from each other.\n",
    "2. Minimize $J(x^{(1)},\\dots, x^{ \\displaystyle(n_m)},\\theta^{(1)},\\dots, \\theta^{ \\displaystyle(n_u)})$ using gradient descent (or an advanced optimization\n",

    "## Implementation Detail: Mean Normalization\n",
    "If the ranking system for movies is used from the previous lectures, then new users (who have watched no\n",
    "movies), will be assigned new movies incorrectly. Specifically, they will be assigned $\\theta$ with all components equal to zero due to the minimization of the regularization term. That is, we assume that the new user will rank all movies 0, which does not seem intuitively correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "We rectify this problem by normalizing the data relative to the mean. First, we use a matrix $Y$ to store the data from previous ratings, where the $i$th row of $Y$ is the ratings for the $i$th movie and the $j$th column corresponds to the ratings for the $j$th user.\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\mu_i= \\frac {\\sum_{i:r(i,j)=1}Y_{i,j}}{\\sum_{j}r(i,j)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is effectively the mean of the previous ratings for the $ith$ movie (where only movies that have been\n",
    "watched by users are counted). We now can normalize the data by subtracting $\\mu$, the mean rating, from the\n",
    "actual ratings for each user (column in matrix $Y$):\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the following matrix $Y$ and mean ratings $\\mu$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y= \\begin{bmatrix}5&5&0&0 \\newline 4&?&?&0 \\newline 0&0&5&4 \\newline 0&0&5&0 \\end{bmatrix} ,\\mu=\\begin{bmatrix}2.5 \\newline 2 \\newline 2.25 \\newline 1.25 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting $Y^\\prime$ vector is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y^\\prime= \\begin{bmatrix}2.5&2.5&-2.5&-2.5 \\newline 2&?&?&-2 \\newline -2.25&-2.25&3.75&1.25 \\newline -1.25&-1.25&3.75&1.25 \\end{bmatrix} $\n",

    "Now we must slightly modify the linear regression prediction to include the mean normalization term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$((\\theta^{(j)})^Tx^{(i)}+\\mu_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for a new user, the initial predicted values will be equal to the $\\mu$ term instead of simply being initialized to zero, which is more accurate."
