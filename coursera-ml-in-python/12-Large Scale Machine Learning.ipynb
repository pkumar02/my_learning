    "We mainly benefit from a very large dataset when our algorithm has high variance when $m$ is small. Recall that\n",
    "if our algorithm has high bias, more data will not have any benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets can often approach such sizes as $m = 100, 000, 000$. In this case, our gradient descent step will have\n",
    "to make a summation over all one hundred million examples. We will want to try to avoid this -- the approaches\n",

    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent is an alternative to classic (or batch) gradient descent and is more efficient and\n",
    "scalable to large data sets.\n",

    "Stochastic gradient descent is written out in a different but similar way:\n",

    "\n",
    "$J_{train}(\\theta)$ is now just the average of the cost applied to all of our training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows\n",
    "1. Randomly 'shuffle' the dataset\n",
    "2. For $i = 1,\\dots,m \\\\ \\qquad \\displaystyle \\Theta_j := \\Theta_j - \\alpha ( h_\\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}).x^{(i)}_j\\;\\;(\\texttt{for}\\;\\;j=0,\\dots,n)$\n",
    "\n",

    "it randomly, but usually yields a result that is close enough.\n",

    "\n",
    "With a smaller learning rate, it is possible that you may get a slightly better solution with stochastic gradient descent. That is because stochastic gradient descent will oscillate and jump around the global minimum, and it will make smaller random jumps with a smaller learning rate.\n",
