    "Let's examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks. At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (**dendrites**) as electrical inputs (called \"spikes\") that are channeled to outputs (**axons**). In our model, our dendrites are like the input features $x_1\\cdots x_n$, and the output is the result of our hypothesis function. In this model our $x_0$ input node is sometimes called the \"bias unit.\" It is always equal to 1. In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification, $\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\theta^Tx}}$, yet we sometimes call it a sigmoid (logistic) activation function. In this situation, our \"theta\" parameters are sometimes called \"weights\".\n",
