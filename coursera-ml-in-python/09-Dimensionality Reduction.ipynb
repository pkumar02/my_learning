    "# Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "## Motivation I: Data Compression\n",
    "We may want to reduce the dimension of our features if we have a lot of redundant data.\n",
    "To do this, we find two highly correlated features, plot them, and make a new line that seems to\n",
    "describe both features accurately. We place all the new features on this single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing dimensionality reduction will reduce the total data we have to store in computer memory and will speed\n",
    "up our learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in dimensionality reduction, we are reducing our features rather than our number of examples. Our\n",
    "variable $m$ will stay the same size; $n$, the number of features each example from $x^{(1)}$ to $x^{(m)}$ carries, will be reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation II: Visualization\n",
    "It is not easy to visualize data that is more than three dimensions. We can reduce the dimensions of our data to 3 or less in order to plot it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find new features, $z1$, $z2$ (and perhaps $z3$) that can effectively summarize all the other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: hundreds of features related to a country's economic system may all be combined into one feature that\n",
    "you call \"Economic Activity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principal Component Analysis Problem\n",
    "### Formulation\n",
    "The most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem formulation\n",
    "Given two features, $x1$ and $x2$, we want to find a single line that effectively describes both features at once. We then map our old features onto this new line to get a new single feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be done with three features, where we map them to a plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **goal of PCA** is to **reduce** the average of all the distances of every feature to the projection line. This is the **projection error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad$Reduce from 2d to 1d: find a direction (a vector $u^{(1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}$) onto which to project the data so as to minimize the projection error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The more general case is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad$Reduce from n-dimension to k-dimension: Find $k$ vectors $u^{(1)},u^{(2)},\\dots,u^{(k)}$ onto which to project the data so as to minimize the projection error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If we are converting from 3d to 2d, we will project our data onto two directions (a plane), so $k$ will be 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PCA is not linear regression\n",
    "* In linear regression, we are minimizing the squared error from every point to our predictor line. These are vertical distances.\n",
    "* In PCA, we are minimizing the shortest distance, or shortest orthogonal distances, to our data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, in linear regression we are taking all our examples in $x$ and applying the parameters in $\\Theta$ to predict $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PCA, we are taking a number of features $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n$, and finding a closest common dataset among them.\n",
    "We aren't trying to predict any result and we aren't applying any theta weights to the features."

    "features to have comparable range of values.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that $x^{(i)}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector, (x^{(i)})^T is an $1 \\times n$ vector and $X\\;\\;\\texttt{is a}\\;\\; n \\times n$ matrix (row-wise stored examples).\n",

    "\n",
    "Also given the total variation in the data:\n",
    "Given the average squared projection error: $ \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\Big\\|x^{(i)}-x_{approx}^{(i)}\\Big\\|^2$\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, the squared projection error divided by the total variation should be less than one percent, so\n",
    "that **99% of the variance is retained**.\n",

    "**Algorithm for choosing** $k$:\n",
    "1. Try PCA with $k = 1, 2,\\dots$\n",

    "## Reconstruction from Compressed Representation\n",
    "If we use PCA to compress our data, how can we uncompress our data, or go back to our original number of\n",
    "features?\n",
    "To go from 1-dimension back to 2d we do: $z \\in \\mathbb{R} \\to  x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$\n",

    "\n",
    "The most common use of PCA is to speed up supervised learning.\n",
    "Given a training set with a large number of features (e.g. $x^{(1)},\\dots,x^{(m)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1000}$) we can use PCA to reduce the\n",
    "number of features in each example of the training set (e.g. $z^{(1)},\\dots,z^{(m)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1000}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we should define the PCA reduction from $x^{(i)}$ to $z^{(i)}$ **only on the training set** and not on the crossvalidation\n",
    "or test sets. You can apply the mapping $z^{(i)}$ to your cross-validation and test sets after it is defined on\n",
    "the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "* Compressions\n",
    "\t* Reduce space of data\n",
    "\t* Speed up algorithm\n",
    "* Visualization of data\n",
    "\t* Choose k = 2 or k = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad use of PCA**: trying to prevent overfitting. We might think that reducing the features with PCA would be an effective way to address overfitting. It might work, but is not recommended because it does not consider the values of our results $y$. Using just regularization will be at least as effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't assume you need to do PCA. **Try your full machine learning algorithm without PCA first**. Then use PCA if you find that you need it."
